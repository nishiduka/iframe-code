# IFrame Code
This is an exercise to render an HTML, CSS and Javascript code on a page. 


## Tecnologies
This project was made using Javascript vanilla and no external frameworks or libs. 

The only lib was used is `serve`, just to helps to see the code runing. If you want, you can use another http server.

### Runing project using serve
```
  yarn install
```

```
  yarn start
```


## How it works
The Javascript is listening to textarea's change and render into an IFrame bellow.
